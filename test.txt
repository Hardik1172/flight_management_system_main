To add images and improve the visual appeal of your SkyHigh Airlines website, you'll need to follow these steps:

Create an images folder:
First, create a folder called "images" inside your static directory. The path should look like this:

Copyyour_project/
    static/
        css/
        js/
        images/

Add background and other images:
Place your desired background image and any other images (like logos, team member photos, etc.) in the images folder.
Update CSS files:
You'll need to update your CSS files to include the background image and style other elements. Here's an example of how to add a background image to your layout_style.css:

body {
    background-image: url('/static/images/sky_background.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    /* ... other existing styles ... */
}

Update HTML files:
You'll need to update your HTML files to include images where appropriate. For example, in the about.html file, you can add team member photos:

    <div class="team-member">
    <img src="{% static 'images/ceo.jpg' %}" alt="CEO">
    <h3>John Doe</h3>
    <p>Chief Executive Officer</p>
</div>

Update layout.html:
Make sure your layout.html file includes the necessary tags to load static files:

{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- ... other head content ... -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/layout_style.css' %}">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style2.css' %}">
    {% block additional_css %}{% endblock %}
</head>
<!-- ... rest of the layout ... -->

Add a logo:
You can add a logo to your navbar in layout.html:

<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark">
    <div class="container">
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">
            <img src="{% static 'images/skyhigh_logo.png' %}" alt="SkyHigh Airlines" height="30">
        </a>
        <!-- ... rest of the navbar ... -->
    </div>
</nav>

Update other pages:
Go through each of your HTML files (index.html, search.html, book.html, etc.) and add relevant images where appropriate. For example, you could add icons to your feature list on the homepage:

   <div class="mt-4">
    <h2>Why Choose SkyHigh Airlines?</h2>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li><img src="{% static 'images/price_icon.png' %}" alt="Price" width="20"> Competitive prices</li>
        <li><img src="{% static 'images/service_icon.png' %}" alt="Service" width="20"> World-class service</li>
        <li><img src="{% static 'images/network_icon.png' %}" alt="Network" width="20"> Extensive route network</li>
        <li><img src="{% static 'images/aircraft_icon.png' %}" alt="Aircraft" width="20"> Modern fleet of aircraft</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Optimize images:
Make sure to optimize your images for web use. They should be appropriately sized and compressed to ensure fast loading times.
Test responsiveness:
After adding images, test your website on different screen sizes to ensure it remains responsive and looks good on all devices.
Update views.py:
If you're adding new data (like team member information) that needs to be passed to the templates, update your views accordingly. For example:

   def about(request):
    team_members = [
        {'name': 'John Doe', 'position': 'CEO', 'image': 'images/ceo.jpg'},
        {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'position': 'COO', 'image': 'images/coo.jpg'},
        {'name': 'Mike Johnson', 'position': 'CFO', 'image': 'images/cfo.jpg'},
    ]
    return render(request, 'about.html', {'team_members': team_members})

Update settings.py:
Ensure your Django settings.py file is correctly configured to serve static files:

pythonCopySTATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
]

Run collectstatic:
If you're deploying to a production environment, don't forget to run the collectstatic command:

Copypython manage.py collectstatic
By following these steps, you'll be able to add images to your project, making the background more attractive and improving the overall look of the website. Remember to choose high-quality, relevant images that c
